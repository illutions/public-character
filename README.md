# Illutions Engine Character Example

This example presents an interactive animated robot character with four selectable animation states, 3D button feedback, orbit controls, and realistic EXR environment lighting using the Illutions Engine.

## Live demo

**[Launch the interactive demo](https://illutions.github.io/public-character/)**
and select the four 3D buttons to switch between character animations.

## What this example demonstrates

- Character animation playback and smooth clip blending
- XState-powered interaction logic for four selectable animation states
- Pointer hover, leave, and click handling on objects inside a GLB scene
- Dynamic material-color feedback for interactive 3D buttons
- Direct Draco-compressed GLB loading and EXR environment lighting
- Custom Illutions object classes for the camera and shadow-catching backdrop
- Orbit controls and antialiased WebGL rendering configured through TypeScript
- Runtime controls for inspecting and tuning the experience

## Why Illutions Engine

Illutions Engine brings the pieces needed for sophisticated browser-based 3D
applications into one configurable workflow:

- **Advanced post-processing**  
Add SSAO, SSR, FXAA and SMAA through configurable pipelines for WebGL and WebGPU.

- **Advanced animation control**  
Coordinate GLTF animation clips, GSAP transitions, camera paths and custom dolly-rig camera workflows.

- **XState-powered application logic**  
Model complex application flows as predictable and inspectable state machines with integrated XState 5 usage.

- **Resource-aware rendering**  
An intelligent, configurable FPS limiter avoids unnecessary frames and helps reduce CPU and GPU load.

- **WebGL and WebGPU rendering**  
Support established and next-generation browser rendering with automatic WebGPU selection and WebGL fallback.

- **Lean initial bundles**  
Optional controls, loaders, inspectors and effects are dynamically imported only when needed.

- **Optimized GLTF/GLB pipeline**  
Load assets with Draco or Meshopt mesh compression and WebP or KTX2 textures.

- **Built-in interaction and audio**  
Use pointer-based raycasting and distance-aware spatial audio.

- **Flexible environments**  
Load HDR, EXR and texture environments with configurable rotation, intensity and background controls.

- **Runtime insights and debugging**  
Inspect runtime properties, FPS, CPU and renderer statistics with detailed state, event and console reporting.

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm
- A browser with WebGL support

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application is served over HTTP at:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

## Type checking

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Build

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The generated files are written to `dist/`.

## Preview

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## License

The example code and project configuration are licensed under the
[Illutions Example Code License](LICENSE.md).

The illutions Engine and illutions-provided build tooling are proprietary
software and are licensed separately. Their complete licensing terms are
provided with the [illutions package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/illutions).
Build permissions are determined by `license/license.json`.

Production builds include the applicable Engine and bundled dependency
licenses in `dist/licenses.md`.

## Deployment

The included GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds and deploys the
project to GitHub Pages on every push to the `main` branch. It can also be
started manually from the Actions tab.

In the repository settings under **Pages**, select **GitHub Actions** as the
deployment source. The workflow provides Vite with the GitHub Pages base path,
while local development continues to use the domain root `/`.
